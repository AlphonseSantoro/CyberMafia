0. Introduction
	This document describes a number of ideas on how the game Mafia Wars will be designed and buildt upon.
	With a user setting based on having a personal desktop that is can attack and hack other players and 
	non-playing characters (NPC), to both hamper others and gain more resources.


1. Desktop Station
	A virtual respresentation of a laptop that can be upgraded by ingame resources earned by the player.
	Certain activities will be needed in order to get access to more gameplay, as a ingame progress bar.
	The player needs to upgrade his station with several to both get access to higher tier attack and
	defence abilities in the game. In order to access mail, a player needs to buy a mail server etc.

2. Resources:
	Crypto mining, hacking, black-mail and attacking are the ways you earn more resources. There are of
	course restrictions on how to managed these. A certain number of attacks/hacks are availible each day
	and cannot be done again before a daily reset. A possible restriction on those could be implemented by
	a "cover" mechanic, where a story NPC helps proxy your IP for only a certain number of attempts,
	while continues attacks will then reviel your IP to other players and NPC's, making you a target.
 
2.1 Crypto Mining:
	One of the upgrade to resource-over-time could be crypto-mining. A simple invest and sit-back mechanic
	that will yield a permanent income for the player for each upgrade. However, if these assets will be 
	specifically targeted by NPC if it becomes too high - as a game balance mechanic.

2.2 Hacking:
	If the player hacks another PC and succeeds, the hack will capture a moderate sum of crypto-currency.
	The main idea is that the hack does not take more than 25% of the players fortune. To avoid greifing
	another barrier should be set at max 40% of total fortune per day could be lost to hacks. The player 
'	needs to invest accets in order to gain more.

2.3 Black-Mail:
	This is an attack specifically meant towards NPCs and missions. The game could describe it as a troyan
	malware attacking the mail server. The malware takes "sensitve information" from the NPC and you get a
	pay-out to avoid you from spreading said information. This attack is very sensitive to being counter-
	attacked and will cause a back-lash if the player has no access to the daily proxxy service.

2.4 Attack:
	Attacks are virus based and do not gain any profit back to the user. You use ingame-currency to buy a
	virus from the ingame market and will destroy the victims accets at a double rate of the invesment.

3. Defense:
	To allow the player the away to defend him/herself from other players and the NPC's, several defence 
	mechanics could be implemented. Each form of attack should have a specific defense. A firewall to stop
	hacks, anti-malware for black-mail and antivirus programs/backups to stop virus.

3.1 Firewall:
	An upgrade that is purchased through the ingame store. A firewall comes with several fixed prices, and
	will conrespondingly stop the attacks with a RNG effect, were high value hack will make a weak firewall
	only slightly reduce the victims loss, while a high value firewall can stop a low value hack with ease.
	
3.2 Anti-malware:
	Stops black-mail trojans from spreading from NPC attacks against you. Other players cannot black-mail 
	each other and may be viewed as PVE.

3.3 Anti-virus:
	To stop virus attacks from succeeding on your PC you can use two options. One is antivirus, and the 
	best option. If the user has several HD installed on the PC and a virus succeeds, there is a RNG effect 
	on how many HD and how much currency/hardware is lost.

3.4 Back-up:
	For every HD you can have a back-up in case of successfull virus attacks. The cost of a back-up is twice 
	the value of a regular HD and there will be a time-delay in both crypto-mining and access to the restored 
	HD in case of the need to restore what was lost. The back-up will not restore a destroyed hardware, but 
	may reduce the lost currency by 50%, as you can only back-up 50% of the HD.

4. Upgrades:
	There should be a several upgrade options for both hardware and software. Details can be quite liberal, 
	but should include: mail-server, HD upgrade, more HD, cryoti-mining cards, graphics card, ram etc.

5. Story:
	TBD - Can be a modernday setting, a retro setting or a fictional one. A possible goal could be to attain 
	political power by amasing money and power through hacking and by tools like fake-news spreading, black-
	mail, hacking twitter accounts as part of smear-campaigns, you win by ruining the reputation of the 
	enemies of your political candidate.
